This page shows some of the results of my final project in Ironhack Data Analysis Bootcamp, trying to give some insights in the process of answering this question, respecting the anonimity of the community involved, thorugh the analysis of the discourse of the shared experiences and it's relationship with the physical space defined by each country."""
